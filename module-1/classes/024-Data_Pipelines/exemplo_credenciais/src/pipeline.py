    The ETL pipeline.
    
    It contains the main nodes of the extract-transform-load 
    pipeline from the process. 
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    
    client: Client
    parmas: Params
    
    Notes 
    -----
    The main idea is to consider each task as a conceptual **node**. 
    This function, `process` is the **pipeline** that integrates all 
    tasks together. Each node is a .py file imported from the `nodes`
    directory. 
    
    The main idea is that each node can be in one of the following state:
        - up-to-date: the task to be done given the input parameters is 
        already completed. Hence, no rework is needed.

        - out-of-date: the task to be done is not completed and should be 
        run.
